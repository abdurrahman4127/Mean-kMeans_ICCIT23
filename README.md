# Mean-kMeans [ICCIT23]

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the **Mean-kMeans** clustering algorithm, an enhanced version of the traditional kMeans algorithm. Our Mean-kMeans algorithm improves clustering performance by optimizing the iteration process and utilizing in-place mean calculations for cluster assignments, thus resulting in faster convergence.

## Mean-kMeans Algorithm Details

Mean-kMeans introduces key enhancements:

- **Dynamic Mean Calculation**: Instead of fixed centroids, the algorithm calculates the mean of points currently assigned to each cluster during each iteration.
- **Optimized Convergence**: By refining the centroid selection and leveraging in-place calculations, the algorithm significantly reduces the number of iterations needed for convergence.


## Installation

To run the code, ensure you have Python installed. You can create a virtual environment for better package management. Use the following commands to set up your environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
And install **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **scikit-learn**, and **pandas** following:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdurrahman4127/Mean-kMeans_ICCIT23.git
   ```
   Then navigate to the repository directory

2. Run the scripts:
   
   - To execute the KMeans clustering algorithm:

     ```bash
     python normal_kmeans.py
     ```

   - To execute the Mean-kMeans clustering algorithm:

     ```bash
     python mean_kmeans.py
     ```

   - To visualize the Elbow method and clustering results, run:

     ```bash
     python elbow_method.py
     ```
